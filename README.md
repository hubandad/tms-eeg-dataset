# TMS-EEG Dataset

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a neuroregulation technique based on the principles of electromagnetic induction and conversion. It has the characteristics of being painless, green, and safe. In the more than 20 years since its birth, TMS has been widely used in clinical and scientific research. Its advent undoubtedly raised the intervention, modulation, and treatment of neural function to a new level.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique for recording electrical activity produced by living brain neurons. EEG has been widely used in clinical diagnosis and treatment as well as scientific research with mature application technology.

Synchronous Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation combined with Electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) combines these two powerful techniques which have enabled researchers to successfully discover micro changes that occur in neurons within the brain when transcranial magnetic stimulation regulates it. For a more systematic review of TMS-EEG technology, please refer to "Characterizing and Modulating Brain Circuitry through Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Combined with Electroencephalography" published in Frontiers in Neural Circuits.

The following datasets are compiled from various sources on the internet for your reference:

**1. Example Data from TESA Toolbox**

TESA (TMS-EEG signal analyzer) toolbox is an open-source extension plugin under eeglab that integrates many functions for preprocessing and analyzing TMS-EEG data with powerful features.

The example data introduced today was shared by Dr Nigel Rogasch at Monash University Clayton School using single-phase TMS EEG data obtained from one subject's left upper parietal lobe under neuro-navigation guidance.

P.S. Another widely used toolbox for analyzing TMS-EEG data is the TMSEEG toolbox http://www.tmseeg.com/

**2. TEPs Data from Different Brodmann Areas**

Four single-trial TEP (Electroencephalographic Potentials Evoked by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) datasets corresponding to four different Brodmann areas (BA4/BA6/ /BA7/BA19). All data have been preprocessed.

**3. TEPs-MEPs Dataset**

TEP and MEP data contributed by Mana Biabani, a researcher at Monash University Clayton School, contains MEP and TEP data obtained during transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex. All data has been preprocessed but raw data can be obtained by contacting Mana.

**5. TMS-EEG Dataset for Cortical Research**

Previous research has shown that different cortical areas of the brain have different neural oscillations. In a study published on the preprint website bioRxiv, researchers used TMS-EEG technology to disrupt the oscillatory activity in three regions of the right hemisphere and measured changes in neural oscillation frequency during rest (N=12) and task states (N=12). The study found that when the brain is actively engaged in a task, it adopts higher dominant frequency patterns regardless of which area was stimulated by TMS, inducing frequencies that dominate across all cortical areas during tasks.
